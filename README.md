## Contribution
### If your pull-request changes code...
...make sure that it is readable and commented. it is not required, just makes reviewing/modifying easier
Before making big changes ask me - "can I do X?", "can i remove Y?", "can I rewrite Z?". In most cases answer will be yes, if this change will not break anything
